This executable calculates the square root of a number in 10 iterations, therefore the result is not accurate.

The purpose of this is to experiment the challenges in CMake tool itself and find better ways to structure the project. No changes will be made to the logic of the SquareRoot calculation

This directory contains source code examples. Each step is an iteration of the previous one.
